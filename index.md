A case study on top 5 factors that contribute to churn among telecom customers using service usage based analysis of high value customers. This case study makes recommendations for a telecom company to reduce churn. In addition to data cleaning and pre-processing steps, this analysis contains a highly interpretable model built using Logistic regression and 3 high performance models built on a pipeline of decomposition using Principal Component Analysis and then modelled using Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost. SMOTE is used to mitigate high data imbalance and Sensitivity metrics are compared for all models.
Libraries : Pandas,StatsModels, Scikit-Learn, imblearn, xgboost,
Concepts : Data Imbalance, SMOTE, Logistic Regression, PCA, ROC-AUC, Sensitivity, Meaningful Missing Values,

Build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

### Bike Sharing

Business data of a hypothetical Bike sharing company was modelled to understand the effects of different factors on the daily demand. The most important factors that influence demand were reported along with an estimate of their measure of importance. Using this data, the business could predict demand with reasonable accuracy and use the insights to strategize business goals. This is an exercise in implementing Linear Regression models for prediction and inference.
Libraries: Scikit-learn, statsmodels, Pandas
Concepts: Pearson's Correlation, Linear Regression, Multi collinearity, Hypothesis Testing.

### Lending Club Case Study

To develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
